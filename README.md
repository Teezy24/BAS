# DSA

## Question 1(Api & Functions): 

Currently the main file is the API and contains the structure(tables) that the client has access to . If you feel it can be improved in terms of adding new attributes ect. just edit and push an update or text on the group.

Lee and I are creating a .yaml file which basically should have all the functions that are in bullet points when you check the dsa assignment question 1.



## Question 2(gRPC):

Marleny, Benjamin and Freddy are responsible for the gRPC part of the project. This is the server side of the project and becomes quit complicated. Once lee and I are  done with the .yaml file, we will start working on the gRPC part of the project with you guys.

### I recommend just  to start with the basic structure of the gRPC and then we can add more functionality to it and then modify it to our needs. When you feel like your changes are worth our attention just push the data so we can switch branches and see what to improve on.
